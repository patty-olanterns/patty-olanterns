- 👋 Hi, I’m @patty-olanterns (aka Pat Dudar). I'm a data enthusiast who loves geography, visuals and using data
     to solve mundane to complex problems! I love problem-solving, but also love being able to keep a process to a 
     problem simple so that an audience can understand it.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, JavaScript and Micrsoft Azure / Amazon AWS data streamlining processes.
     There is never enough time to learn all languages, and I find Python to be the most versatile and user-friendly
     language for the masses.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects using energy, business and environmental datasets to streamline and
     optimize processes!
